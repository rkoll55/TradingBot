# Algorithmic Trading Bot

An algorithmic trading bot I made in my free time. The bot uses technical analysis to determine whether to buy or sell a stock. The following technical indicators are utilised:


Stochastic analysis
Moving Averages
Relative Strength Index (RSI)


The bot also features a logging system to keep track of its performance and decision-making process.

The bot works by connecting to Alpaca API and pulling data for an active account.
